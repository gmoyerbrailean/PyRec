CHANGE LOG
===================
Version 3.1
-Fixed issue that caused the MAMA primer to form a PCR pair with the reverse primer, rather than the forward primer
-Fixed issue that caused incorrect reporting of oligos with the '_B' designation (e.g., genes with an ambiguous lagging strand)
-Fixed issue that caused the reported mismatch location to be off by one
-Added a module that outputs FASTA files of genes with the mismatches
-Added a warning when a gene is present multiple times within the genome

Version 3.0
-Disabled BLASTing for organisms with closed genomes (searches scaffold instead)

-Added option to report all possible oligos

-Added a module to detect sequences with an increased chance for false positive MAMA screens
-Added full compatability for Windows users
-Adjusted file locations and directory structure

-Fixed issue that caused incorrect reporting of the forward and reverse primers

-Fixed issue that caused a fasta file with multiple genes to generate one csv output that continuously overwrote itself 




Version 2.4.1
-Fixed issue where the pcr product was not being checked for the restriction site

Version 2.4

-Modified length of oligo to be 90 every time

-Fixed issue that caused inaccurate cutsite reporting in the excel file

-Incorporated the design of a MAMA oligo





Version 2.3

-Added the ability to parse for combintation cut site and stop site

-Fixed issue that caused lowercase sequences to not get parsed

-Fixed issue that created oligos one nt shorter than they should have been



Version 2.2
-Fixed issue where csv files were not being saved to the correct location

-Added feature that allows the user to select and parse other organisms



Version 2.1

-Fixed restriction mode oligos to capitalize only the mismatched bases

-Fixed issue with restriction mode that would output a blank csv file if all the restriction sites were found within the pcr product



Version 2.0

-Added Restriction mode

-Added a graphical user interface

-Discontinued MAMA mode



Version 1.3

-Added ability for user to specify a genome



Version 1.2

-Fixed issue that blocked the return of a template strand MAMA-primer if neither a coding primer or the second screening primer were returned
-Fixed error that was causing the template-strand dna parser to return mismatches without a t-t or a c-c
-Added a testing script to check that the dna parsing is working correctly

-Added a screen to remove patterns that have been associated with getting false positives in vitro
-Added a container module for DNA-specific classes



Version 1.1

-Fixed issue where a template strand MAMA
-primer was not being oriented 5'-3' if the oligo was also based on the template strand

-Fixed issue where the closest possible primer to 60' was not always being returned

-Fixed the 83mer oligo design so that only oligos of 83 in length could be returned

-Fixed issue with the doublestop module creating an A-A mismatch

-Added single-stop only mode

-Changed output file naming method for genes that are not matched in the mm4 gene list

-Changed output of the 83-mer to highlight the mismatched nucleotides

-Added the ability to define the beginning and ending locations to search for mutations
